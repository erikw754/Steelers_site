      <p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hines Ward was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the third round of the 1998 NFL Draft. Ward played his entire professional career for the Steelers and he became the team's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yardage and touchdown receptions. Ward was voted MVP of Super Bowl XL and upon retirement was one of eleven NFL players to have at least 1,000 career receptions. </span></p>
      <p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 2003, the Steelers voted him their team MVP as he caught a total of 95 receptions for 1,163 yards and 10 touchdowns for the season. He was voted, along with Faneca, to his third consecutive Pro Bowl. On November 13, 2005, Ward became the Steelers' all-time leading receiver with his 538th catch against the Browns on ESPN Sunday Night Football surpassing John Stallworth's record. </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p>                 
      <p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ward's versatility, hands, and willingness to block served him well as a professional wide receiver. Since being drafted by the Steelers in the third round of the 1998 NFL Draft, he earned three team Most Valuable Player (MVP) selections. He was also a four-time NFL Pro Bowl selection (2001â€“2004). Ward also had a streak of 4 consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. The streak was broken in the 2005 NFL season during which he missed a game due to injury. In 2002, he set a Steelers franchise record for receptions (112) and touchdowns (12) (both since broken by Antonio Brown) and was named to his first of two consecutive All-NFL teams.  </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p>
