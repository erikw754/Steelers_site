He was the 22nd of 27 wide receivers selected in the draft, and the second by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He picked the jersey number 84, which he explained: "Eight times four is 32. Thirty-two teams looked past me, even the Steelers. So every time I go out there it’s a little added motivation." </span></p>
        <p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On September 19, 2010, Brown made his NFL debut against the Tennessee Titans and returned two kickoffs and a punt for 128 yards, including an 89-yard touchdown from a reverse on the first play of the game. On October 3, Brown made his first NFL catch for a six-yard gain during a 17–14 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 4. On July 28, 2012, the Steelers signed Brown to a five-year, $42.5 million extension that included an $8.5 million signing bonus </span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p>                 
        <p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On January 3, 2014, Brown was named to the AP All-Pro team for the first time in his career. In the 2016 season, Brown posted his fourth consecutive and fifth career season with at least 1,000 receiving yards, earning him his fourth consecutive and fifth career Pro Bowl selection on December 20, 2016. He was named First Team All-Pro for the third consecutive time. On February 27, 2017, Brown signed a new five-year contract with the Steelers through the 2021 season. The contract was a four-year extension worth $68 million ($19 million guaranteed at signing) with a $17 million annual salary, making Brown the highest paid wide receiver in the NFL. In the season opener against the Cleveland Browns, Brown reached 10,000 career receiving yards. He achieved the milestone in 116 career games; only two NFL players have reached the mark in fewer games</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p>
